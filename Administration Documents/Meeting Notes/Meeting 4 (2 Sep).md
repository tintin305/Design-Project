For the phasing (maths), it may not be worth putting in all of the detail. It is more of an explanation that is required.

Does the antenna system need a radome?

The exclusion process can be used. There can be components in the appendix which go through other design options and why they were not chosen.

Where it doesn't work is just as important as where it does work. This can form part of the considerations for the side lobes.

Power levels allowed for specific frequencies. Power levels in the lobes.


In the radar handbook (14.4), the probability of detection with an acceptable probability of false alarm (this includes allowance for a +10 dB receiver noise figure)
